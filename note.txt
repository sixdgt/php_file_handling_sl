Basic File Handling in PHP.

There are 3 modes.
1. Read 'r'
2. Write 'w'
3. Append 'a'

Methods
1. fopen() - to open file from specified location. will raise exception if the file is not found

2. fread() - to read content of the file. will raise exception if the file is not available in the specified location

3. fwrite() - to write new content or add content after existing content in file. will create new file if the file doesn't exist

4. filesize() - to check the size of file 
5. fclose() - to close lastly open file 

Note: Here we read and write content of text file
